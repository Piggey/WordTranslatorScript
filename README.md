# WordTranslatorScript
Using an Yandex's Translation API it takes a formatted .txt file of words you want to translate and translates them outputting a new translation.txt file.

The translation is primarily set to Polish -> English, but can be easily changed to whatever language is supported by the tranlation API.

# How to use the script
1.Create your own *.txt file with the words that you want to translate. (**Note**: the words HAVE TO be formatted the same as in the test.txt file)

2.Simply drag your .txt file onto the script.py file.

3.As an output you should recieve the translation.txt file in the same directory as your script
