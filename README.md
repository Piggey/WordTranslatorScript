# WordTranslatorScript
Using an Yandex's Translation API it takes a formatted .txt file of words you want to translate and translates them outputting a new translation.txt file.

The translation is primarily set to Polish -> English, but can be easily changed to whatever language is supported by the tranlation API.

# How to use the script
0. Get your own Yandex's Translator API key [here](https://translate.yandex.com/developers/keys/) and paste it to the __keys.py__ file.

1. Create your own *.txt file with the words that you want to translate. (**Note**: the words **HAVE TO** be formatted the same as in the __test.txt__ file)

2. Simply drag your .txt file onto the __script.py__ file.

3. As an output you should recieve the __translation.txt__ file in the same directory as your script
